# Asteroids-2D
Made this game to practice some of the skills I learned while taking courses on unity
In it's current state the game is fully functional gameplay wise except for the need to restart the application once you win or lose.
Objective is to safely pilot a spaceship to avoid asteroids floating in space. 
The game is won when all asteroids are successfully destroyed.
Asteroids when shot are split in two smaller halves.
Once the asteroid in less than 1/4 its original size it is completely destroyed.
Game includes sound effects as well.
Controls: Thrust: Space Bar
          Shoot: LCTRL
          Rotate: Left and Right arrow
